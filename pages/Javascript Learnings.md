- use de-structuring for arrays also
- ```
  const name = "zakria jan";
  const [firstName, lastName] = name.split(" ");
  ```
- use toggle for adding and removing class in vanilla js
- ```
  const elem = document.querySelector("selector-query");
  elem.classList.toggle("class-to-be-added-and-removed")
  ```
- To view which code is changing the specific element in the DOM
